## Inspiration

As students navigating busy schedules, we understand the universal challenge of achieving quality sleep. With the goal of contributing to a more balanced day and enhancing well-being, we are thrilled to introduce our project: *zZz - Sleep Tracker*.

## Functionality

Our project comprises three main features:
- *Clock:* Users can set personalized alarms to track their sleeping schedules.
- *Tracker:* Utilizing data from the preceding tab, users can explore individualized sleep analytics through visually engaging graphs, empowering them to reflect on and improve their sleep patterns.
- *Tips for a Restful Night:* As a conclusion, users can access foundational advice aimed at enhancing the overall quality of their sleep.

## Implementation

We built the user-friendly website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Additionally, Canva was employed for design enhancements to ensure both functionality and visual appeal.

## Challenges Faced

Filtering and deciding on practical functionalities during ideation posed challenges. Our team navigated prioritization difficulties based on familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, leading to the regrettable elimination of certain ideas due to limited expertise.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Despite being relatively new to front-end design and website functionality, our team rapidly acquired essential skills overnight. We successfully finalized ideas, divided responsibilities, and brought our envisioned website design to life.

## What we learned

Adapting and improvising with limited resources were key lessons learned during this experience. Emphasizing and leveraging each team member's unique expertise enhanced the overall project.

## What's next for zZz - Sleep Tracker

To elevate our project in the foreseeable future, we aspire to expand our scope by incorporating larger datasets that consider users' personalized information, including factors like BMI, stress levels, and occupation. This expansion will allow us to create personalized profiles, summarizing and tracking individual sleeping patterns and habits. With this comprehensive data, we aim to generate more in-depth advice tailored to the specific needs of each user and potentially publish an application for more convenience.
